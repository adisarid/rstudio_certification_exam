# Sample Lesson Exercise on purrr - for an rstudio trainer certification

## How this repo is organized

The "class plans" folder contains the background work done to build the lesson, along with the concept map (see file class-plan-canvas-purrr).

The teachR.pdf is a cheat sheet I devised (and published on rstudio's website) for building lessons.

## Lecture materials

In the lecture folder there are two files, the pptx is the presentation and the Purrr-exercise.R is the exercise file (faded examples).
In class we will focus on only one of the three exercises in the file.
