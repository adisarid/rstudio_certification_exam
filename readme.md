# Sample Lesson Exercise on purrr - for an rstudio trainer certification

The task was to prepare a 15-minute lesson on a topic related to R, RStudio products, or data science. 
The repository contains all the materials related to the task.

## How this repo is organized

The "class plans" folder contains the background work done to build the lesson, along with the concept map (see file class-plan-canvas-purrr).

The teachR.pdf is a cheat sheet I devised (and published on rstudio's website) for building lessons.

## Lecture materials

In the lecture folder there are two files, the pptx is the presentation and the Purrr-exercise.R is the exercise file (faded examples).
In class we will focus on only one of the three exercises in the file.

## Learner persona

Shay has a BA in social sciences and has been working for a startup in TLV for the last 15 months. 
Shay has been working for the startup as an advanced analyst. He spends most of his time coding in R and preparing R Markdown documents to help drive decision making in the firm, and keep track of operations. 

Most of Shay's tasks require data munging and visualization. Shay's knowledge is not "formal", in the sense that most of the knowledge was aquired during "on job training".

Shay is a "false expert": he is fluent in base R, has some knowledge in tidyverse, and knows his way around SQL. However, Shay understands he lacks the fundementals and that he needs to strengthen his "basis" in a formal manner. In addition, Shay is missing a lot of "best practices" which help make his work more efficient and organized.

The startup Shay works for has issued a corporate training course which includes tidyverse, modeling, and some statistical theory. The course is targeted at "intermediate" learners (similar to Shay).

## This sample lesson

This sample lesson takes us into the 4th meeting of the course where we discuss purrr. Subjects such as the data science workflow, dplyr, tidyr, ggplot2, and similar, were already discussed in previous meetings.
